# Changelog

## 1.0 (2017-06-03)

### Note

SharpRevise is available for use but with very limited functionality. You can assign a global hotkey, add comments, and save the changelog. To customize categories, simply edit the settings.json file (will appear after the first application launch).

### To do

The next version (1.1) will include the following:

* Menu

	* Integrate menu events (exit, build & preview, etc.)

	* Build & Preview will save the changelog and open a browser window to preview

* Open and update changelog

* Assign version to changelog

* Assign release date to changelog

* Edit categories through GUI

* Allow application to minimize to system tray

* Create setting to minimize main window on launch

* Delete selected comment

* Code refactoring
